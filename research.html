          <h4>MotionInput</h4>
          <p>To start our project, we had to conduct a thorough investigation of MotionInput's
             existing technologies and applications. Our research revealed that the software 
             was developed by academics and students at UCL, providing users with the ability 
             to interact with their computer through touchless technology. MotionInput uses
              a webcam to detect various gestures made by the user's face, head, hands, full body, 
              and speech. These interactions are analyzed by the software, which converts them
               into signals, allowing the user to control their device effortlessly.
            <br>
            <br>
            To ensure that our project was an improvement over the previous version, we conducted
             a comprehensive analysis of the codebase. We carefully scrutinized the design and 
             functionality of the software, identifying any issues that could be addressed to 
             enhance its performance. This process enabled us to compile a comprehensive list 
             of requirements for our project.</p>
             <br>
        <p>
            To achieve our goals, we began by examining the current source code repository and 
            testing it on various devices. This allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the 
            software's operation and gain an understanding of how it functions. We carefully 
            analyzed the code, looking for areas that required improvement or optimization to
             enhance the software's functionality. Through this process, we identified several 
             key areas that could be improved, and we developed strategies to address these 
             issues in our project. Our research formed the foundation for the development of 
             a robust and efficient software system that would meet the needs of our clients
              and users.

        <h4>CAD softwares</h4>
        <p>
            Our project had a specific focus on customizing MotionInput for CAD software. 
            To achieve this goal, we dedicated time to researching various CAD software
             available in the market. CAD, or computer-aided design, software is a valuable 
             tool that enables users to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of 
             real-world products before they are manufactured. In our research, we explored 
             the software features and functionality of prominent CAD software such as AutoCAD 
             and SketchUp.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            AutoCAD, a CAD software developed by AutoDesk, is primarily designed for 
            architectural design. Its interface is sophisticated and complex, but it has 
            a broad range of features that make creating industrial-specific designs more 
            straightforward. With its ability to work in 2D and 3D planes, the software is 
            highly versatile, catering to different professionals' needs. We delved into the 
            software's various modes and features, creating an extensive list for reference.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            SketchUp is another CAD software that is well-suited for 3D modelling purposes, 
            including architectural design. Compared to AutoCAD, SketchUp has a simpler
             interface, with fewer functions and a more interactive workspace. Like AutoCAD,
              it also operates in both 2D and 3D planes, which further expands its potential
              applications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            While AutoCAD and SketchUp were both great choices for our project's focus on 
            architectural design, we also researched the usage of TinkerCAD. As we progressed 
            with our project, we realized that including a software that was simpler to use
            and more suitable for all ages would be more intuitive.  TinkerCAD is an ideal 
            choice as it can be used for creating architectural designs
             and modelling objects, as well as programming blocks. With its versatility and
              user-friendly interface, TinkerCAD is well-suited for individuals of all ages
               and skill levels.

                          In this video, we discuss the topic of Architectural CAD, its definition, 
                          and a few common examples of CAD applications such as SketchUP and AutoCAD.
                           We also delve into the concept of gestural input, which allows users to interact 
                           with CAD software using hand, face and speech gestures. Finally, we talk about 
                           some of the most common CAD commands that are frequently used in architectural 
                           design.</p>
