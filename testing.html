          <p>

            During the process of testing our program on both Autocad and Sketchup,
             we encountered some obstacles related to speech recognition. The issues 
             we faced included the program often detecting incorrect words or picking 
             up a lot of background noise, making it more challenging to use. To overcome 
             these challenges, we decided to create specific dictionaries for each software
              that we used. For example, we developed a Sketchup-specific dictionary that 
              only contained words necessary for the softwares features. This approach 
              allowed us to map other words to 'unk,' which prevented the program from 
              misinterpreting them. We also found that the detection of specific commands 
              became more accurate by mapping words like 'orbiting'
              to 'orbit,' providing users with greater flexibility in their use of 
                speech commands.
                <br><br>
            One of the main advantages of developing these separate dictionaries is 
            that you can easily switch between them. For instance, users can change 
            dictionaries by saying "switch dictionary Autocad." Additionally, since 
            Autocad and Tinkercad have different lists of features, creating separate
            dictionaries for each software helped to increase accuracy in the use of
            speech commands. After implementing these measures, we observed a 
            significant improvement in program performance, with a 35% increase 
            in accuracy, and almost all words were accurately detected. 
            The overall operation of the program also became much smoother, 
            providing a more seamless user experience.

            <!-- ======= Facial calibration ======= -->

            <h2>Facial calibration</h2>
            <p>
                During our testing phase, we encountered a problem related to the 
                accuracy of our facial navigation feature. It was only successful 
                in accurately identifying 20% of the users, as it was unresponsive 
                for some while being overly sensitive for others. This made it 
                challenging to use, and we realised that it required a performance
                 boost to improve user experience.

                To address this issue, we decided to implement the facial calibration
                 feature to tailor facial navigation specifically to the user's face. 
                 The primary objective of this feature is to simplify the facial
                  navigation process by ensuring that the program is accurately
                   calibrated for each individual's unique facial features.
                
                This feature includes a series of screens that prompt users to move 
                certain parts of their face, which are typically used in facial 
                navigation. This calibration process helps the program adjust its 
                sensitivity levels based on the scope of the user's facial expressions, 
                making it more precise and accurate.
                
               
                  <br><br>
                  During the implementation of the facial calibration feature, we 
                  encountered a few challenges during its execution. Firstly, during 
                  the calibration process, the program required the user to look all 
                  the way to the side, which prevented them from seeing if the screen 
                  had changed yet. However, we later discovered that the feature 
                  included a sound notification that indicated the completion of each
                   mode of calibration. This sound made it easier for the user to
                    track their progress during the calibration process and eliminated 
                    the issue of not being able to see the screen.
                
                  However, after successfully calibrating the facial navigation feature, 
                  we discovered that some of its functions, such as dragging, became 
                  more difficult to use. Additionally, the fps (frames per second) 
                  dropped, which caused navigation to become less smooth. This decrease
                   in functionality and usability could make the feature impractical 
                   to use in architectural CAD software.
                  
                  Overall, although there are some places that need improvement, facial
                   navigation became 2x more accurate than before.
