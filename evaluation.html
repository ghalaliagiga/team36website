        <h2>Critical Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>User Interface</h3>

        <p>For our project, we took the user interface as a top priority and invested a significant 
            amount of time in iterating and designing the best possible design.

            Our team has designed the user interface and system with a high level of intuitiveness
             and ease of understanding. We have carefully considered every aspect of the design, 
             from the layout to the color scheme, to ensure that it is visually appealing and easy to use.

            By prioritizing the user interface design, we have created a system that is both
             intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in the experience.
              The design has also made it easier for users to learn and understand the system, reducing 
              the need for training or support.

        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>In terms of the requirements given to us and the goals we created, our project
            has completed all of these and even surpassed. The MoSCoW list is essentially
            all completed ignoring the requirements concerning PseudoVR but this is because
            we changed project direction. Throughout the project, although we faced some 
            unexpected obstacles, we maintained excellent communication and worked together
            to create new and creative solutions. <strong>4 / 5</strong>

        </p>
        <br>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Stability</h3>
        <p>Testing was important to us so that we could ensure our program was up to a good
            enough standard to be used and so that it surpassed all the given requirements. 
            Given the range of testing that was conducted, from unit testing to 
            user acceptance testing, we can instil confidence in the stability of our
            program and its usability amongst users. <strong>5 / 5</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <p>The program includes smooth dragging for most gesture modes but very rarely
            faces some minor problems for example in recognizing speech commands. This 
            has already been mostly combatted with specific dictionaries and filtering 
            of words that are irrelevant. Fortunately, these do not greatly affect the 
            overall efficiency of the program. <strong>4 / 5</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Compatability</h3>
        <p>Our team has conducted thorough testing to ensure that our program is compatible 
            with a wide range of Windows devices that have the necessary hardware. This includes
            a working microphone to detect speech commands and a webcam for facial and hand gestures.
             However, due to its specific development for the Windows platform, it cannot 
             be used on devices that run on alternate operating systems.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Maintainability</h3>
        <p>As we collaborated with several teams on the project, we prioritized the organization 
            and maintainability of our code. Our aim was to ensure that future teams could 
            effortlessly build upon our work and extend the project to meet evolving needs.
</p><br><p>
            To achieve this goal, we employed industry best practices in software development, 
            including modular design, clear documentation, and efficient coding techniques. Our 
            team recognized that maintainable code is critical for long-term success, and we 
            implemented robust testing and debugging processes to detect and resolve issues quickly.
            We focused on creating a scalable and flexible architecture that could 
            accommodate future updates and enhancements without major code overhauls. This approach 
            allowed us to reduce technical debt and minimize the risk of project stagnation.
            
            <strong> 5 / 5</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Management</h3>

        <p>Our team was highly organized and maintained excellent communication 
            throughout the project. We held regular meetings, typically on a weekly
             basis, and made sure to take detailed meeting notes for reference and 
             organization. This approach allowed us to closely monitor our progress
              and make informed decisions for the future of the project.
</p><br><p>
            Thanks to our well-structured approach, we were able to face obstacles with
             relative ease. Even when faced with challenges, our team was able to remain 
             resilient and work together to overcome them. In essence, our organized 
             approach had a positive impact on the project, enabling us to operate smoothly
              and efficiently even in the face of unexpected hurdles. <strong>5 / 5</strong>

            <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
            <p>It's essential to evaluate a project's successes and areas of improvement continually. While we 
                    are proud of the progress we have made, there are still some bugs and challenges we faced. 
                    One area that requires further improvement is the reliability of facial navigation and dragging.
                     Specifically, we noticed that users experience lag and inaccuracies when attempting to move to
                     the right. This issue is particularly problematic when trying to navigate a 3D space, where 
                     precision is key.

                    Another issue we faced was related to our facial gestures mode. While it was designed to work 
                    seamlessly with speech commands, we noticed that some users accidentally triggered a smiling 
                    gesture when speaking. This problem is especially concerning as it can lead to conflicting or 
                    unwanted commands being executed. However, by identifying these issues, we can continue to 
                    refine and improve our system, ensuring that it meets the needs and expectations of our users.</p>

                                Looking ahead, an area for improvement in our project is the usability of facial navigation. 
                                To enhance the user experience, it is important to implement changes that will make this feature
                                function more efficiently and intuitively.
