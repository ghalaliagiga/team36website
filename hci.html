          <h2>Direct Observation</h2>
            <p>Our app is designed for architects and interior designers who use CAD software 
              to create mockups for their clients. To ensure that it meets the needs of 
              these professionals, we chose to gather user requirements through direct 
              observation in the field and 1-to-1 semi-structured interviews with architects 
              and designers. Our app involves an unusual method of interaction - hand gestures 
              and/or speech commands - so observing users directly would provide us with valuable
               insights to validate our concept.

            </p><br><br>
            <p>
            <strong>Observation Sample:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
                1. The architect walked up to the display.
                After they waved to start the demo, they raised their left hand 
                    to locate the cursor and click the 'Enter house' button.<br>
                2. They then hesitated to decide which room to visit from the floor 
                    plan that popped up next.<br>
                3. They nodded their head as they clicked the first room – kitchen. 
                    They stopped and looked slightly puzzled as they tilt their head. 
                    They turned to the interviewer and asked if they can look around 
                    the virtual room.<br>
                4. After the interviewer explained the pinch gesture for panning 
                    the camera, the architect smiles and successfully started
                     looking around the room.<br>
                5. The client stepped in and had a look themselves.<br>
                <br>
           
         
            <strong>1-to-1 semi-structured interviews</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            How did you feel upon opening the display?
            <br>
            <p>
            
            <i>I felt hesitant to use gestures at first, but the instructions were
             clear and the navigation by pinching buttons was surprisingly easy to use.</i><br>
            
            Did you feel that the main menu and instructions were easy to understand?
            
            <i>I felt that everything was labelled clearly and it was obvious to me 
            which buttons I had to press to access different parts of the navigation, 
            however I wouldn't have thought to pan the camera with my hands.</i><br>
            
            Were you able to present the property in a satisfactory way to your client?
            
            <i>Yes, the floor plan menu allowed me to easily access which room I 
            wanted, and the client enjoyed being able to cycle through the rooms already 
            visited.</i><br>
            
            How does this compare how you would perform this task without the software?
            
            <i>I found the application a big benefit for presentations, I can see myself 
            integrating this into my day-to-day work providing the setup isn't too much 
            of a hassle.</i><br>
            <br>

                <p>Upon opening our app, Glenda took a systematic approach, taking time 
                  to read the main menu and appreciating that the program contained options
                   to input data whilst seated instead of standing. Glenda was happy that

                   the app that mapped very well her daily life. She also specifically 
                   liked that, as the architect, she could sit down with her clients
                    and explain all parts of the property in contrast to before where
                    she wasn’t as involved in the properties viewing due to her disability.</p>

                <strong>Bryan - Undergraduate Student </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Bryan is currently an interior design student who has basic subject
                  knowledge and has experience using technology in his daily life. Whilst
                   at university, Bryan already utilizes similar programs and he believes 
                   that learning how to this application will be a beneficial addition 
                   to his skillset. Furthermore, it would also increase his chances in 
                   securing an internship considering his burgeoning interest in using CAD 
                   software. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Bryan opened our app, he dove straight into working out how to utilize 
                      its features via trial and error. Due to his technology and gaming background,
                       he quickly became very familiar with the environment. He quickly was able 
                       to understand the options in the main menu and was soon enjoying navigating 
                       around the house whilst  using the orbiting features to look in detail 
                       around each room.  It was easy for him to learn how to navigate throughout
                        the house and he didn’t waste much time adapting to the new environment</p>

              <h2>Sketches + Prototypes</h2>
              <p>Initially, we embarked on a mission to design a range of sketches that were specifically
                tailored to our primary objective, which was to create a pseudo VR walkthrough experience.
                 Our creative process involved conceptualizing a variety of sketches that would enable 
                 users to navigate through virtual rooms using different tracking modes. One of our key
                  design elements included the incorporation of a floorplan that allowed users to select
                   which room they wanted to explore. Additionally, we integrated buttons into each room,
                    which facilitated seamless navigation and the ability to change rooms effortlessly.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <img style="width:600px;" src="assets/img/oldsketch.png">
              <img style="width:600px;" src="assets/img/oldsketch2.png">
              <br><br><br>
              <p>
                Throughout the project, our requirements and objectives evolved, which prompted us to shift
                 our approach. Consequently, our sketches were altered to accommodate the new design of the MFC 
                 and the workplane in each CAD software. This change required us to include the possibility of
                  switching between CAD 
                   software, modifying tracking mode, and even creating specific trigger phrases to make speech 
                   commands more efficient.
              
                To achieve these objectives, we went through a series of iterations to create the best 
                possible design. These took into account every 
                detail and aspect of the experience to ensure that we created a seamless and intuitive experience
                 for our users. Below, you can see the various iterations we went through 
                 and the final product that we produced.

              <br>
              <br>

              <p>After numerous iterations and careful consideration, we ultimately settled on a final design for
                 the MFC that proved to be incredibly efficient and user-friendly. Our final design was a result 
                 of taking into account all the features we had implemented while ensuring that it remained clear 
                 and easy for users to navigate. The design was intuitive and enabled users to adjust all parameters 
                 relevant to navigating with ease, regardless of which tracking mode and CAD software they used. 
                 Our design approach was user-centric, and we focused on making sure that users could access all the 
                essential features without any difficulty.</p>
