          <h2>Direct Observation</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Observation Sample:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
                1. The architect walked up to the display.
                After they waved to start the demo, they raised their left hand 
                    to locate the cursor and click the 'Enter house' button.<br>
                2. They then hesitated to decide which room to visit from the floor 
                    plan that popped up next.<br>
                3. They nodded their head as they clicked the first room – kitchen. 
                    They stopped and looked slightly puzzled as they tilt their head. 
                    They turned to the interviewer and asked if they can look around 
                    the virtual room.<br>
                4. After the interviewer explained the pinch gesture for panning 
                    the camera, the architect smiles and successfully started
                     looking around the room.<br>
                5. The client stepped in and had a look themselves.<br>
                <br>
           
         
            <strong>1-to-1 semi-structured interviews</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            How did you feel upon opening the display?
            <br>
            <p>
            
            <i>I felt hesitant to use gestures at first, but the instructions were
             clear and the navigation by pinching buttons was surprisingly easy to use.</i><br>
            
            Did you feel that the main menu and instructions were easy to understand?
            
            <i>I felt that everything was labelled clearly and it was obvious to me 
            which buttons I had to press to access different parts of the navigation, 
            however I wouldn't have thought to pan the camera with my hands.</i><br>
            
            Were you able to present the property in a satisfactory way to your client?
            
            <i>Yes, the floor plan menu allowed me to easily access which room I 
            wanted, and the client enjoyed being able to cycle through the rooms already 
            visited.</i><br>
            
            How does this compare how you would perform this task without the software?
            
            <i>I found the application a big benefit for presentations, I can see myself 
            integrating this into my day-to-day work providing the setup isn't too much 
            of a hassle.</i><br>

            Glenda (architect)
            
            <br>
            <br>

            Glenda is an experienced architect who has been presenting her properties to 
            clients for many decades but has little experience with using technology 
            in her work.  On an average day, Glenda helps her clients view her 
            properties and look around to view different sections or rooms. She wants 
            to learn how to use this software to hopefully improve her position at 
            work and increase her client's satisfaction. She is currently in a
             wheelchair due to her recent hip-replacement surgery and therefore 
             requires accessibility adjustments.
             <br>
            Upon opening our app, Glenda took a systematic approach, taking time 
            to read the main menu and appreciating that the program contained options
             to input data whilst seated instead of standing. Glenda was happy that 
             she could enter each room based on the floorplan; a functionality of 
             the app that mapped very well her daily life. She also specifically 
             liked that, as the architect, she could sit down with her clients
              and explain all parts of the property in contrast to before where
               she wasn’t as involved in the properties viewing due to her disability.

            Bryan (undergraduate student)
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Bryan is currently an interior design student who has basic subject
             knowledge and has experience using technology in his daily life. Whilst
              at university, Bryan already utilizes similar programs and he believes 
              that learning how to this application will be a beneficial addition 
              to his skillset. Furthermore, it would also increase his chances in 
              securing an internship considering his burgeoning interest in using CAD 
              software. 
              <br>
            When Bryan opened our app, he dove straight into working out how to utilize 
            its features via trial and error. Due to his technology and gaming background,
             he quickly became very familiar with the environment. He quickly was able 
             to understand the options in the main menu and was soon enjoying navigating 
             around the house whilst  using the orbiting features to look in detail 
             around each room.  It was easy for him to learn how to navigate throughout
              the house and he didn’t waste much time adapting to the new environment.</p>
